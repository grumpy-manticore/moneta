# About Me

Wow, I really don't know what to put here.

My name is Nick Telsan.

I'm a web developer currently living in Chattanooga, Tennessee and presently working at [Viget](https://viget.com).

I've worn a lot of different hats since joining the world wide web of world web developers; SRE, dev ops, identity specialist, backend developer, and frontend developer.

For the past few years, I've been a JavaScript developer - primarily focusing on building bespoke frontends and UI for a number of clients. These have ranged from COVID-19 testing apps built purely in React, to full-stack web apps with NextJS, and even to embeddable micro-frontends for WordPress sites.

These days, I'm expanding my horizons back out - focusing on Go and TypeScript as my "daily-driver" languages.

Outside of work, I'm a die-hard World of Warcraft fan, but also enjoy a nice mix of other - typically indie - games. I also run my own long-form tabletop roleplaying game.

If you're interested in working with me, drop me a line at <a mailto="me@nicktelsan.com">me@nicktelsan.com</a>!
